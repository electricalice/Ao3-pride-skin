## How to add a skin to your AO3 account

* Make sure you're logged in your account on AO3
* go to **my dashboard** and then click on **Skins** (in the menu on the right)
* click on the button **create new skin**
* Make sure Type is **Site Skin**
* Add a Title to your skin
* Select and Copy the code of the flag you'll find in the css folder of this repository.
  * The flags should be self explanatory, they are several different files, each one with the code for a flag. You only need to install the one that you want. Not all of them.
* Paste the code **in the field 'CSS'**
* click **SUBMIT**
* scroll to the bottom on the page and click on "USE"
  **Now you have a new skin! It is now linked to your account, so every time you log into ao3 from whatever device you'll have it already set!**


## How to add parent skins

If you, for example, use reversi as a skin

* Make sure you're logged in your account on AO3
* go to **my dashboard** and then click on **Skins** (in the menu on the right)
* find **the skin you just created** and click on **Edit** (the skin is probably the top one)
* Scroll down and click on **advanced, show**
* Then scroll down and click on **Add parent skin**
* **type your skin in the autocomplete and select it!** (Reversi? Snow Blue? Another skin you've created to block works? )
* click on **update**



## How to remove the skin

* Make sure you're logged in your account on AO3
* go to 'my dashboard' and then click on 'Skins' (n the menu' on the right)
